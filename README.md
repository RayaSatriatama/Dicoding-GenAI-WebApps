# Dicoding Generative AI Web Application

## Executive Summary

Indonesiaâ€™s educational technology sector faces significant challenges in leveraging Generative AI, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini for Bahasa Indonesia on Google Cloud. This project addresses these challenges by building a Generative AI system tailored for Dicoding, enabling automated, curriculum-aligned content generation and improving contextual accuracy in forums and chats. 

Our solution integrates Gemini LLM with a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application, streamlining content creation, enhancing accessibility, and boosting learner engagement. By automating manual processes, this system establishes a scalable foundation for advancing AI-driven education in Indonesia.

## Environment Variables

### Frontend `.env` Example
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
VITE_IMAGE_KIT_ENDPOINT=your_imagekit_endpoint
VITE_IMAGE_KIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_imagekit_public_key
VITE_GEMINI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_gemini_public_key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend `.env` Example
```env
IMAGE_KIT_ENDPOINT=your_imagekit_endpoint
IMAGE_KIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_imagekit_public_key
IMAGE_KIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_imagekit_private_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
MONGO=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

## Usage

### Generating Content

1. Navigate to the web application.
2. Input prompts in Bahasa Indonesia for curriculum-aligned content or assessments.
3. View the generated output, fine-tuned for Dicoding's needs.

### Chat and Forum Support

- Use the chat/forum feature to ask questions. The system provides contextually accurate responses in Bahasa Indonesia.

## How It Works

1. **Frontend**: React handles user input and communicates with the backend via API calls.
2. **Backend**: Node.js processes requests, interacts with Gemini API, and fetches data from MongoDB.
3. **Gemini Integration**:
   - Prompts sent to Google Cloud's Gemini API.
   - Responses generated and returned to the user.

---

## Deployment

1. Deploy the frontend using services like Vercel or Netlify.
2. Deploy the backend on a cloud hosting platform (e.g., Google Cloud or Heroku).
3. Ensure `.env` files are securely managed and credentials are not exposed.
